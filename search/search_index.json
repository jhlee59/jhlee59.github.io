Through the process of benchmarking and drafting, our team identified these features as the most effective and feasible. For a more in depth look into Trash Canner, the team's documentation is available here. The weight sensors are linked to LEDs, providing a clear visual alert to the user when the trash needs to be taken out. The primary objective is to assist the buyer in their daily lives by simplifying a chore. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My contribution was to design the motion sensor system that triggers the lid to open without using a pedal or any other manual way. This system uses a motion or ultrasonic sensor to detect the user. Once the user is detected, my system sends a signal to another system's  microcontroller, which then sends information to a motor. This causes the lid to open and then close after a short time (see the block diagram and schematic for details). I had to select all the necessary parts for this sensor system, as detailed in the component list. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Individal Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This block diagram shows a motion sensor powered by a 5V, 1.5A voltage regulator, which powers all the components. The motion sensor sends a signal that is filtered by the Op Amp to the microcontroller. The microcontroller reads the sensor through an analog input, and if motion is detected, it sends a digital signal to Riley\u2019s board through pin 2. The board then activates a motor to open the trash can lid. </p> <p></p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":""},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#motion-sensor","title":"Motion Sensor","text":"<ol> <li>HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sonar Distance Sensor + 2 x 10K resistors</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$3.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons 10cm-250cm range 15 degree Beam angle Compatible with microcontrollers Weights 8.7g Somewhat Inexpensive <ol> <li>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - 3V or 5V - HC-SR04 compatible - RCWL-1601 </li> </ol> <ul> <li>$3.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons 10cm-250cm range Low current Compatible with microcontrollers Smaller dimensions than Option 1 <ol> <li>US-100 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - 3V or 5V Logic</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$6.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons 10cm-250cm range Lightly more expensive Removable back Only Compatible with Arduino or CircuitPython Low current <p>Choice: Option 2: RCWL-1601</p> <p>Rationale: The RCWL-1601 offers the same range as traditional HC-SR04 sensors while consuming less current and taking up less space.
