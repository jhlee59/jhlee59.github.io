Through the process of benchmarking and drafting, our team identified these features as the most effective and feasible. For a more in depth look into Trash Canner, the team's documentation is available here. The weight sensors are linked to LEDs, providing a clear visual alert to the user when the trash needs to be taken out. The primary objective is to assist the buyer in their daily lives by simplifying a chore. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<p>My contribution was to design the motion and distance sensor system that triggers the lid to open without using a pedal or any other manual way. This system uses two emitter and detector sensors to detect the user and how full the trash can is. Once the user is detected, my system sends a signal to another system's  microcontroller, which then sends information to a motor. This causes the lid to open and then close after a short time. Then the distance sensor sends a signal to a different microcontroller to inform the buyer if the trash can is full. See in the block diagram and schematic for details). I had to select all the necessary parts for this sensor system, as detailed in the component list. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Individual Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This block diagram shows a motion sensor powered by a 5V, 1.5A voltage regulator, which powers all the components. The motion sensor sends a signal that is filtered by the Op Amp to the microcontroller. The microcontroller reads the sensor through an analog input, and if motion is detected, it sends a digital signal to Riley\u2019s board through pin 2. The board then activates a motor to open the trash can lid. This has changed.</p> <p>This new block diagram now supports two IR Reflective Optical Sensors, still powered by a 5V, 1.5A voltage regulator, which powers all the components. One of the sensors is constantly detecting for motion while the other sensor is measuring how much depth there is in the trashcan. These signals are filtered by the Op Amp and then sent to the microcontroller, where they are translated into a digital signal. That signal is then sent to two other microcontrollers to open the can or impact an LED scale. One to Riley's board and one to Gael's.</p> <p>OLD:  </p> <p>NEW: </p> <p>Connection Table | Pin | From | To | Type| Description|  |:--------------------|:----|:---------------|:-----|:--------|:-----|:-----|:----|:-----| | 1 | - | - | - | not used | | 2 | Hattie (Me)(RB2) | Riley (RA2) | 0V / 5V Digital |  | | 3 | Hattie (Me)(RD3) | Gael (RE0) | 0V / 5V Digital |  | | 4 | Gael (RF1) | Alessandro (RC1) | 0V / 5V Digital |  | | 5 |  - | - | - | not used | | 6 |  - | - | - | not used | | 7 |  - | - | - | not used | | 8 | Ground | Ground | Ground | Ground |</p> <p>PDF available here</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":"<p>I chose the OPB732 Reflector Emitter and Detector, the MCP6241-E/P operational amplifier, and the L7805ABV voltage regulator because they work together to create a reliable and efficient automatic trash can that enhances convenience and durability. The OPB732 provides accurate distance detection, allowing the lid to open smoothly and quickly when a user approaches. Additionally, alert the user when the trash is full. The MCP6241-E/P op amp improves signal accuracy between the sensor and the microcontroller, ensuring the lid operates consistently without unexpected movement. The L7805ABV voltage regulator supplies a steady 5V output and includes built-in protection against overheating and short circuits, helping the electronics last longer and stay safe. Together, these components make the trash can quiet, dependable, and easy to use while keeping the overall design affordable and practical for everyday households.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#motion-sensor","title":"Motion Sensor","text":"<ol> <li>OPB732 Emitter and Detector Reflective Optical Sensor 3\"</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$4.61/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Doesn't have a daughter board Single Beam range Compatible with microcontrollers Inexpensive <ol> <li>Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - 3V or 5V - HC-SR04 compatible - RCWL-1601 </li> </ol> <ul> <li>$3.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons 10cm-250cm range Low current Compatible with microcontrollers Has a daughter board Smaller dimensions than Option 1 <ol> <li>US-100 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - 3V or 5V Logic</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$6.95/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons 10cm-250cm range has a daughter board Removable back Only Compatible with Arduino or CircuitPython Low current <p>Choice: Option 1: OPB732</p> <p>Rationale: The OPB732 is the best choice because it is the simplest Emitter and detector with which I have experience, and it doesn't have a daughter board connected. </p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#op-amp","title":"Op Amp","text":"<ol> <li>MCP6004-I/P</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$0.59/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Inexpensive 3 Op Amp will go unused Through Hole Mount Larger footprint <ol> <li>MCP6241-E/P</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$0.43/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Small Limited to one Op Amp Through hole mount Low current Voltage Flexible <ol> <li>IC INVERTER 1CH 1-INP SOT23-5</li> </ol> <ul> <li>$0.12/each</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Small Doesn't read continuous signals Cleans up signals Surface mount <p>Choice: Option 1: MCP6004-I/P</p> <p>Rationale: The MCP6241 features only one op amp in the package, eliminating unnecessary components and minimizing PCB space.
