## Overview
This block diagram shows a motion sensor powered by a 5V, 1.5A voltage regulator, which powers all the components. The motion sensor sends a signal that is filtered by the Op Amp to the microcontroller. The microcontroller reads the sensor through an analog input, and if motion is detected, it sends a digital signal to Rileyâ€™s board through pin 2. The board then activates a motor to open the trash can lid.
