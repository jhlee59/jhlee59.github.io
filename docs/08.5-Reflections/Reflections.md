## Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, our team identified five important lessons that helped us successfully complete the hardware and sensor system. First, we learned that verifying every pin connection and signal path early is crucial because even a single incorrect pin can cause significant delays. Second, we learned that testing each component individually before integrating the system makes troubleshooting faster and prevents confusion. Third, we discovered the importance of clear and organized schematics, especially when working with multiple sensors and microcontrollers. Fourth, we learned that having an accurate power budget is essential for preventing component issues and ensuring stable operation. Finally, we learned that good communication and consistently updating documents, such as the block diagram, BOM, and status reports, keep the whole team aligned and reduce mistakes during hardware development.

## Recommendations for Future Students
1. Start your design work early and update your block diagram and schematic often, because your design will change throughout the project.
2. Double-check every pin connection using datasheets, your schematic, and a multimeter, since incorrect pins are one of the most common and time-consuming mistakes.
3. Test each sensor and component individually before combining them into the full system, which makes finding problems much easier.
4. Learn how to read and understand datasheets well, because most important design decisions depend on voltage limits, pin functions, and current requirements.
5. Stay organized and document everything, including wiring changes, code updates, and component selections, so your final report is easier and your hardware is more reliable.
