## Lessons Learned
During this project, I learned the importance of testing every connection carefully and verifying which pins are being used before proceeding. Even one incorrect pin assignment can cause the entire system to not work, especially when multiple sensors and microcontrollers are involved. I realized how valuable it is to trace each signal path on the schematic, confirm it again in the PCB layout, and then test it physically with a multimeter once the board is built. I also learned that double-checking datasheets and verifying pin functions prevents a lot of troubleshooting later. Making sure all connections are correct before powering the board saves time, protects the components, and leads to a much smoother testing process overall.

## Recommendations for Future Students
For future students building a similar system, I recommend starting your design earlier than you think you need to, especially the schematic and PCB layout. Double-check every connection before ordering parts, and always verify your power requirements to prevent damage during testing. Keep your block diagram updated as your design changes—it will save time and prevent mistakes later.
