title: Power Budget
---

## Overview
A Power Budget is created to ensure that every component in an electrical system receives the correct voltage and sufficient current to operate safely and reliably. It calculates the total power requirements of all devices, verifies that voltage regulators and power supplies can handle the total load. By organizing components by their voltage rails and current draws, the Power Budget also assists in selecting appropriate regulators and external power sources while documenting design decisions for troubleshooting and validation. Overall, it ensures the system is both electrically stable and efficiently powered.

## Conclusions

From the prepared Power Budget, it can be concluded that the system’s power requirements are well balanced and adequately supported by the selected regulators and external power source.
