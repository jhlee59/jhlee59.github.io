## Introduction

This datasheet documents my individual contribution to the Trash Canner Project. It includes the following: my block diagram, component selection, bill of materials, schematic, and power budget.

### Project Summary

The Trash Canner Project is an automatic trash can design featuring weight, distance and motion sensors. Through the process of benchmarking and drafting, our team identified these features as the most effective and feasible. For a more in depth look into Trash Canner, the team's documentation is available [here](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-207.github.io/). The weight sensors are linked to LEDs, providing a clear visual alert to the user when the trash needs to be taken out. The primary objective is to assist the buyer in their daily lives by simplifying a chore. 

### My Contribution

My contribution was to design the motion and distance sensor system that triggers the lid to open without using a pedal or any other manual way. This system uses two emitter and detector sensors to detect the user and how full the trash can is. Once the user is detected, my system sends a signal to another system's  microcontroller, which then sends information to a motor. This causes the lid to open and then close after a short time. Then the distance sensor sends a signal to a different microcontroller to inform the buyer if the trash can is full. See in the [block diagram](https://jhlee59.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/) and [schematic](https://jhlee59.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/) for details). I had to select all the necessary parts for this sensor system, as detailed in the [component](https://jhlee59.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/) list.
