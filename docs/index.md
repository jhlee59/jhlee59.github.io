## Introduction

This datasheet documents my individual contribution to the Trash Canner Project. It includes the following: my block diagram, component selection, bill of materials, schematic, and power budget.

### Project Summary

The Trash Canner Project is an automatic trash can design featuring weight and motion sensors. Through the process of benchmarking and drafting, our team identified these features as the most effective and feasible. For a more in depth look into Trash Canner, the team's documentation is available [here](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-207.github.io/). Both the weight and motion sensors are linked to LEDs, providing a clear visual alert to the user when the trash needs to be taken out. The primary objective is to assist the user in their daily lives by simplifying a chore. 

### My Contribution

My contribution was to design the motion sensor system that triggers the lid to open without using a pedal or any other manual way. This system uses a motion or ultrasonic sensor to detect the user. Once the user is detected, my system sends a signal to another system's  microcontroller, which then sends information to a motor and an LED. This causes the lid to open and then close after a short time (see the [block diagram](https://jhlee59.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/) and [schematic](https://jhlee59.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/) for details). I had to select all the necessary parts for this sensor system, as detailed in the [component](https://jhlee59.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/) list.
